My name is Franklin Ndubuisi. This is Lab Assignment 5 for CS2010. The program demonstrates the use of generic templates to enable operations with any primitive data types. It focuses on managing and processing vectors of vectors in C++ efficiently.

The program provides a range of utilities, including:

Initialization: Easily set up vectors and vector of vectors.
Zipping: Combine two vectors element-wise to create paired sub-vectors.
Filtering: Retain elements based on specific conditions.
Mapping: Apply transformations to all elements.
Reducing: Combine elements into a single value.
Printing: Neatly format and display vectors with square brackets [ ] and zipped pairs with parentheses ( ).
This assignment showcases modular and reusable design for complex vector operations, emphasizing the versatility of generic programming.
